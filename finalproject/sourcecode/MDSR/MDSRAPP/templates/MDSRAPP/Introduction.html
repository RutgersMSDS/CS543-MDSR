    <h4><div class = "gfg4">Nowadays with the development of modern industries, human beings are using more
        and more metal materials. Someday we eventually will use up the world’s resources on the
        earth. In a quest to solve problems like these, most of us escape into gazing at the sky,
        turning to the boundless universe. However, as we know, there are countably infinite planets.
        Traversing all those trillions of celestial bodies will take more than a person’s entire life. So,
        our spectacular interstellar journey may start with a research to scoop the secrets of the stars
        at the center of the galaxy, starting with analysis of the huge data (~100 Gb).</div>

    <div class = "gfg4">This project belongs to CS543: Massive Data Storage and Retrieval developed by Group 1. We provide an
        interactive map demonstrating the information of more than 600 million stars in the Milky Way which is
        based on a catalog released by the European Southern Observatory (ESO). The stars are divided into 196 tiles
        which cover the Galactic bulge by their location in space. Graph waves are also provided. Each star in each tile
        represents vertices in a graph, and the distance
        between the stars are calculated to create edge in a graph.</div></h4>
